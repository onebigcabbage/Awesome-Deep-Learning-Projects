Apple has released the first beta of iOS 12.3 and tvOS 12.3 to developers. The developments comes just a few days since it released iOS 12.2 which came with support for Apple News+ and new Animoji. The new 12.3 betas include the new Apple TV app which is scheduled to officially launch in May. The new TV app replaces the old ones and includes categories such as movies, sports, and news.
In order to install the beta software, you will need a supported device and be registered on the Apple Developer Center. From there you can download the software or fetch it over-the-air once you've configured the correct profile. You can read more about installing beta software on iOS and Apple TV devices on Apple’s support page. For those of you with Apple’s third-generation set-top box, the firm has released a beta version of Apple TV Software 7.3 which can be downloaded and installed via iTunes. According to Apple, this beta "provides support for testing AirPlay from your apps to Apple TV (3rd generation)".
Unfortunately, no release notes have been published with the iOS or tvOS betas so it looks as though we’ll have the wait for testers to uncover all the new features. Be sure to keep an eye on Neowin’s home page for any updates.
